# Franklin's Book Template

Book-like template for [Thibaut Lienart](https://github.com/tlienart)'s [Franklin.jl](https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl) web-site generator, based on 
[Rik Huijzer](https://github.com/rikhuijzer)'s CSS for [Books.jl](https://github.com/JuliaBooks/Books.jl).

The idea is to provide a menu bar for and navigation links between different content pages, treated like sections of a book.

This is an off-spring of the draft template in [tlienart/booksjl-franklin](https://github.com/tlienart/booksjl-franklin).
