#' # Weaved Julia Script

#' This page was generated from a **julia script**, automatically converted to markdown with [Weave.jl](https://github.com/JunoLab/Weave.jl). The conversion happens automatically when the menu is constructed.

#' ## Julia Dots

#' PNG with path relative to site, i.e. `/assets/images/julia-logo-dots-small.png`, but this only works in the Franklin-rendered site:

#' ![Julia dots](/assets/images/julia-logo-dots-small.png)

#' ## Julia Speeder

#' GIF with path relative to file but within `_assets/`, i.e. `../../_assets/images/juliaspeeder32x32.gif`, and postprocessed accordingly, so it works both in Franklin and in Weave:

#' ![Julia speeder](../../_assets/images/juliaspeeder32x32.gif)

#' ## Math

#' Inline, as in $e^{i\pi} = -1$, or in a block:
#' $$
#' \exp(i\pi) + 1 = 0
#' $$

#' ## Code chunks

#' Here is a julia chunk:

x = 1

#' and another:

println("hello world!")

#' ## Load file

#' Keep in mind that Weave renders this from the directory where the file will be weaved to, which is different from the way Literate handles it (*c.f.* Section [literatejl.jl](/pages/literated/literatejl)):

pwd()

#' With that settled, we can use the proper path:

open("../../_assets/data/wow.txt") do io
    read(io, String)
end

#' ## Plot

using Plots

x = 0.0:0.01:2Ï€
y = sin.(2x) + sin.(5x)

plot(x, y, title = "A nice wave", titlefont=12, label = false)
