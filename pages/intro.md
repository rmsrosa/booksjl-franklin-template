@def title = "Introduction"

# {{ get_title }}

With this template, you have the table of contents in the menu bar on the left of each page and navigation links on the top and bottom of each page.

The structure of the menu should be configured in the file `config.md`, at the root directory of the project. Both the menu bar and the navigation buttons are automatically built from this structure. Each page can be numbered, if so configured.

Pages can be generated from markdown files or julia scripts, rendered by either [Franklin.jl](https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl), [Weave.jl](https://github.com/JunoLab/Weave.jl), or [Literate.jl](https://github.com/fredrikekre/Literate.jl).

More details in the appropriate sections.
