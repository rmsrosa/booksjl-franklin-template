# Introduction

With this template, you have a menu bar on the left and navigation buttons on the bottom of each page.

The menu bar displays the Table of Contents, with links to each section/subsection of the book.

The structure of the menu should be configured in the file `config.md`, at the root directory of the project. Both the menu bar and the navigation buttons are automatically built from this structure.

More details in the appropriate sections, at your disposal in the menu bar.
