# {{ get_title }}

In the following subsections, we build essentially the same content but in different ways, as markdowns, scripts or jupyter notebooks, rendered by either [Franklin.jl](https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl) alone or together with [Weave.jl](https://github.com/JunoLab/Weave.jl) or [Literate.jl](https://github.com/fredrikekre/Literate.jl):

* Section {{link_section pages/franklinmd}} (only Franklin);
* Section {{link_section pages/weaved/weavejl}} (Weave followed by Franklin);
* Section {{link_section pages/weaved/weavejmd}} (Weave followed by Franklin);
* Section {{link_section pages/literated/literatejl}} (Literate followed by Franklin);
* Section {{link_section pages/jupytered/notebookipynb}} (Weave followed by Franklin).
