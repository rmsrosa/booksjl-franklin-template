A good portion, and the inspiration, for the style sheet used here is that of the CSS in [Rik Huijzer](https://github.com/rikhuijzer)'s [Books.jl](https://github.com/JuliaBooks/Books.jl) package.

Some changes have been made, such as adding a link to the Github repo and the name of the author in the menu bar; adding an optional background image; adjusting the font sizes; adding an optional top navigation bar; several configuration variables; etc.

The style can also be tweaked as you like it, in [`_css/basic.css`](/css/basic.css).

Important elements to notice are the colors, font sizes and background image set in `:root` and `html`, and the fontface for code blocks, set in `pre code kbd samp`.

One should also pay attention to the `_assets/images/favicon.png`. It is currently set to a red question mark, as in [Franklin.jl](https://github.com/tlienart/Franklin.jl), to draw attention to it. Just replace the file with your favorite icon meaningful to your book or remove the line that loads the icon in `_layout/head.html` if you don't want any.
