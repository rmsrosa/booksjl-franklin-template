A good portion, and the inspiration, for the style sheet used here is that of the CSS in [Rik Huijzer](https://github.com/rikhuijzer)'s [Books.jl](https://github.com/JuliaBooks/Books.jl) package.

Some small changes have been made, such as adding a link to the Github repo and the name of the author in the menu bar; slighly casting an overall beige hue to the site; adding an optional background image; adjusting the font sizes; adding an optional top navigation bar; etc.

Those can also be tweaked as you like it, in [`_css/basic.css`](/css/basic.css).

Important elements to notice are the colors, font sizes and background image set in `:root` and `html`, and the fontface for code blocks, set in `pre code kbd samp`.
