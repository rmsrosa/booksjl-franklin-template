@def title = "Weaved Julia Markdown"

# {{ get_title }}

This page was generated from a **julia markdown script**, automatically converted to markdown with [Weave.jl](https://github.com/JunoLab/Weave.jl). The conversion happens when the menu is constructed.

## Julia Dots

PNG with path relative to site, i.e. `/assets/images/julia-logo-dots-small.png`, but this only works in the Franklin-rendered site:

![Julia dots](/assets/images/julia-logo-dots-small.png)

## Julia Speeder

GIF with path relative to file but within `_assets/`, i.e. `../../_assets/images/juliaspeeder32x32.gif`, and postprocessed accordingly, so it works both in Franklin and in Weave:

![Julia speeder](/assets/images/juliaspeeder32x32.gif)

## Math

Inline, as in $e^{i\pi} = -1$, or in a block:
$$
\exp(i\pi) + 1 = 0
$$

## Code chunks

Here is a julia chunk:

```julia
x = 1
```

```
1
```





and another:

```julia
println("hello world!")
```

```
hello world!
```





## Load file

Keep in mind that Weave renders this from the directory where the file will be weaved to, which is different from the way Literate handles it (*c.f.* Section {{link_section pages/literated/literatejl}}):

```julia
pwd()
```

```
"/Users/rrosa/Documents/git_repositories/julia/booksjl-franklin-template/pa
ges/weaved"
```





With that settled, we can use the proper path:

```julia
open("../../_assets/data/wow.txt") do io
    read(io, String)
end
```

```
"Wow, this seems like a cool template!"
```





## Plot

```julia
using Plots
```


```julia
x = 0.0:0.01:2Ï€
y = sin.(2x) + sin.(5x)
plot(x, y, title = "A nice wave", titlefont=12, label = false)
```
